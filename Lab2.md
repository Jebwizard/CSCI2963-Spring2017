#####Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
  When you choose a licence, you can make your software "free" or "libre". Without it, no one has any rights to use your software.
  They can't use it anyway they want, they can't study it, they can't modify it, and they can't distribute it. AKA it can't provide
  any of the 4 freedoms. Thus your code can't help the rest of the coding commmnity.

#####Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
  Wen you use a project without a lincnce, you are limiting your ablility to use the code. You have no rights to modify and distribute
  the project. This is fine if you never use the projcet outside of your own use case, but the moment you give a copy to anyone for
  anything, you are breaking copyright.  
  
#####Do you agree with this claim?
  I agree that not allowing others to be involved does restrict the human resources avalible to the project. I think that the Gopher
  developers wanted to have as much control as possible and this put them in conflict with the ethos of the web as a free domain. I see
  that there is a fine line between controlling a project and letting all comming a free reign.
 
#####Can you justify why such a license is chosen (Justification for ONE is enough).
  Linux requires that any dirivative software provide the origional code to it new users. This makes since for Linus becuase the new user
  should know what the new project is based on. If I install a new version of Linux, under the GPL I have the ability to look at the
  source code of the linux distro that was the bases of the new version I just installed.
  
#####Think of an example project. Pick a license (as a group) using the LICENSE chooser by Github.
  A school final project where I code the backend for a Formal Logic theorum solver. Using a MIT License would allow anyone to use
  my efforts, but since I am not planning on distrubuting this or using this commercially I do not need to restrict any access to this.
  MIT also requires that anyone who tries to use my code for their final project have to admit to using my work.
  
#####Read these licenses GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better - for a developer, for a company and for the common good - write 5 to 10 sentences.
  #####Developer:
    Apache - Only minimal restrictions that allows others to use the works of the developer
  #####Company:
    GNU GPL - This allows others to use their code, but requires them to acknowledge that the company orignionally produce the product.
  #####Common Good:
     LGPL - This allows for complete freedom to modify and use, and only requires acknoledgement of the source when the code is use in
     a larger project.
  
  #####Create a repository and choose a license.
    Added a MIT License to my CSCI2963-Spring2017 Repo
    
#####Write five sentences about choosing a project to work on in this course, who will be users/customers of the project, 
  and what license will you choose.
    I would like to program an automatic formal proof solver. This would also have a front end interface to help in the proving of the validity of logic arguments. This would be used by future students of RPI Logc courses. The intent is to give them a program that will help them visulize a descision procedure as well as having some capability to check their work. A MIT license would allow future students to improve on my work in furture semestes.

#####Take 5 projects from Observatory or past RCOS Projects and create a table for which project has which license.
