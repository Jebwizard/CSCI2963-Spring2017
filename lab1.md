I have found that asking in a class forum the night an assignment is due is NOT useful for anyone. If a problem is urgent, it is my own problem. Others can help, but they are not the ones with the deadline.
Spend more time web searching for an answer then you do posting your question on a forum. You can almost always find your solution. Especially for HW or class projects.

Well, I think it is absurd that the RIAA claimed that he had caused damages. Especially to the dollar amount they claimed. As the chapter stated, he was using the University's internet, with publicly avalible data, with publicly avalible code to provide a service where a minority of the data was music files. How does the RIAA justify that he hurt them? This also shows how fuzzy the internet makes copyright laws. Before the internet, music pirates had to invest hardware and materials to steal music. It is easy to see if a copy of recorded music is legal or not. Then with the internet and computers, it is easy to copy a file. It takes no extra hardware, no extra materials. Just some time. I understand that Jesse's software was being used to copy music, but so is EVERY other file sharing service. Why is the RIAA not bankrupting Google because if Google Drive?

 I would like to program an automatic formal proof solver. This would also have a front end interface to help in the proving of the validity of logic arguments. This would be used by future students of RPI Logc courses. The intent is to give them a program that will help them visulize a descision procedure as well as having some capability to check their work. A MIT license would allow future students to improve on my work in furture semestes.
